// Put the demo back to its opening state WITHOUT deleting anything.
//
// The old version deleted decision_log rows, which quietly contradicted the
// thing we claim on stage: that the log is append-only and every action is on
// the record. Eric noticed the row count go down. If a judge can make rows
// disappear, the audit trail is not an audit trail.
//
// So this deletes nothing. It resets autonomy, closes out anything still open,
// and writes a `session_reset` marker. Views show entries since the most
// recent marker, which gives a clean demo and an intact history.
//
// `--forget` additionally clears learned facts. Off by default, and needed only
// for the memory A/B: learned facts survive every rehearsal, so by the third
// practice run the "before" half is no longer clean and the comparison means
// nothing. It deletes only rows in `context_notes` whose source marks them as
// learned. That is memory, not the audit trail, and the `learned` entries in
// `decision_log` still record that it happened.
//
//   npm run demo:reset
//   npm run demo:reset -- --forget
